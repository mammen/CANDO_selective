    "CANDO is a similarity-based drug discovery platform, meaning it predicts new drugs for given indications based on their similarity to existing drugs within that indication. It calculates similarity by comparing the multitarget interactions of a given compound to those of the drugs of interest. Any quantifiable interaction between a compound and biological system can be used for this purpose, and multiple types of interactions can even be combined. For this tutorial, we will be using a series of compound-protein binding scores as our interaction signature."

CANDO has multiple in-house pipelines to create such scores based on small molecule drug chemical structure and protein binding pocket data (generated by [the Zhang group's protein binding site prediction algorithm, COACH](https://zhanggroup.org/COACH/)). These pipelines, CANDOCK and BANDOCK, can be used to create a protein library or add new proteins you think might be relevant to an existing protein library. Once these binding scores are generated,  they are arranged into a vector or list corresponding to each compound: the *proteomic signature* of that compound. These proteomic signatures are arranged into a drug-protein interaction matrix. Once this matrix is created, alongside a corresponding lists of compounds and any known compound-indication associations, CANDO can be used to make novel drug predictions."

    "To prepare for novel drug or indication prediction, CANDO first creates a compound-compound similarity matrix. Similarity scores are calculated based on the compound interaction signatures, with more similar interaction signatures having a higher similarity score. Finally, for each drug with a known effect, a sorted list of the most similar compounds to that drug is created. To predict a new drug for a given indication, the most similar compounds to all drugs already in that indication are compared. If a non-indicated drug is very similar to multiple inidcated drugs, that is, it appears in the top ranks of multiple similar lists, it will be predicted as a possible new drug in that indication. Likewise, to predict a new indication for a given compound, the indications of the drugs most similar to it are found. If multiple drugs similar to the compound have the same inidcation, the indication is returned as a potential use for that compound."

Benchmarking ensures that our platform has predictive value and that we know how much to trust the predictions we are working with.\n",

    "CANDO has a primary built-in benchmarking protocol, as well as multiple older benchmarking functions. We will focus on the primary benchmarking protocol, `canbenchmark_new`, here. This method uses a leave-one-out benchmarking protocol on every indication with two or more associated drugs. Every drug is withheld from its indication, and CANDO predicts novel drugs for that indication based on the remaining drugs. If the left out drug appears in these predictions, that is considered a success, as CANDO is able to predict the efficacy of that drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary benchmarking function calculates four metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **New average indication accuracy (nAIA)** - float, average % of indicated drugs that can be predicted within a given cutoff\n",
    "  - The \"new\" distinguishes these metrics from old average indication accuracy, as calculated by our older benchmarking functions\n",
    "  - A **Control nAIA** is also provided; this is the nAIA we would anticipate if CANDO worked as well as random chance\n",
    "- **Pairwise accuracy (PA)** - float, % of drugs that appear within a given cutoff in the similarity lists of drugs with the same indication\n",
    "  - PA assesses similarity list quality, whereas nAIA assesses prediction quality\n",
    "- **Indication coverage (IC)** - integer, the number of indications with a non-zero indication accuracy\n",
    "- **Normalized discounted cumulative gain (nNDCG)** - float, scores # indicated drugs predicted within a given cutoff with prioritization of early recall\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher scores in these metrics should lead to higher confidence in our predictions. Additional metrics, such as precision at a given rank or area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC/AUC), may also be calculated. See the [the CANDO documentation](https://github.com/ram-compbio/CANDO/blob/master/docs/CANDO-v2.2.pdf) or [this paper on evaluating drug repurposing technologies](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.03.410274v1) for more information about metrics."

CANDO also outperforms random chance (control-nAIA) at every cutoff.

However, paricalcitol, dihydrotachysterol, and calcitriol are all in each other's top 10 most similar compounds lists.

    "The function generate_matrix() first creates a dataframe for all chemical fingerprint similarity scores comparing each compound in the specified version library v (or only approved drugs with approved_only=True) to every potential binding site ligand from the PDB using RDKit to compute the chemical fingerprints in which fp denotes the type/radius of fingerprint (rd_ecfp4, rd_ecfp8, etc). The vector type, vect, can be binary (\"1024_bit\" or \"2048_bit\") or integer (\"int\") and denote the presence or absence or count of molecular substructures in the molecule, respectively. If using integer vectors, dist should be set to \"dice\", but binary vectors can be set to Tanimoto (\"tani\"). Next, it creates a dataframe of all potential binding sites for each protein in the specified protein library, protlib, with their corresponding binding site scores from the specified binding site prediction method, bs (\"coach\", \"cof\", \"ssite\", \"tms\"). The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the best score based on the following input parameters: 1) i_score - the scoring protocol of choice, which can be 'C', 'dC', 'P', 'CxP', 'dCxP', where C is the fingerprint similarity score (either Tanimoto or Sorenson-Dice coefficient), dC is the percentile of the C score for the compound compared to all ligands in the library, and P is binding site score associated with the ligand predicted by the COACH algorithm, 2) c_cutoff and p_cutoff - set cutoffs which ignore any C or P scores below each threshold, respectively, and 3) percentile_cutoff - similar to c_cutoff but with the dC score (overrides c_cutoff if not None). These scores serve as a proxy for binding strength/probability of the drug and protein target. We then output the matrix to a tsv file, out_file, which in this case is \"tutorial_matrix-all.tsv\" (out_path can be set to write the file to a specific directory).\n",

This function is parallelized, so setting the variable ncpus will change the number of processors that are used for this function. NOTE: percentile cutoff protocols ('dC', 'dCxP') take much longer to compute than 'C' and 'P' protocols. "

    "Sometimes there are no drugs associated with an indication (whether it be in reality or in your input indication mapping); in those cases we can use the `canpredict_denovo()` function to suggest putative candidates. Basically, this function counts/sums the number of protein interaction scores above a set threshold for each compound and ranks them according to frequency and strength. This is particularly useful for pathogen proteomes (like SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial proteomes) or for finding which compounds target a subset of proteins of interest (e.g. kinases). In our case, we have a diverse set of proteins, which would render the results meaningless. Instead, we can input a list of protein IDs in which we are interested. We have precompiled a list of bacterial proteins already present in the sample matrix for convenience. Note: if we had read in an indication-genes mapping file, we could use the `ind_id=` parameter to automatically select all proteins associated with said indication. "

Instead of generating a new matrix with all of these proteins and their corresponding interaction values, which can begin to take up a lot of storage if done multiple times, the `'protein_set='` flag can be specified during the instantiation of the CANDO object. This flag contains the path to the protein subset the user wishes to use, which is simply a list of UniProt protein IDs. The CANDO object will automatically check for each ID if it either simply matches any UniProt IDs within the matrix or if that UniProt ID is associated with any PDB chains within the matrix (based on a mapping from the SIFTs project). If there are matches, the CANDO object will now contain Compound objects with only those protein interaction values in their signatures. Below is how to use this functionality - this time we can search for the bacterial proteins from the previous `canpredict_denovo()` section, but filter the proteins from the start using a list of UniProt IDs.
