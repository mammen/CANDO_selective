    "CANDO is a similarity-based drug discovery platform, meaning it predicts new drugs for given indications based on their similarity to existing drugs within that indication. It calculates similarity by comparing the multitarget interactions of a given compound to those of the drugs of interest. Any quantifiable interaction between a compound and biological system can be used for this purpose, and multiple types of interactions can even be combined. For this tutorial, we will be using a series of compound-protein binding scores as our interaction signature."

CANDO has multiple in-house pipelines to create such scores based on small molecule drug chemical structure and protein binding pocket data (generated by [the Zhang group's protein binding site prediction algorithm, COACH](https://zhanggroup.org/COACH/)). These pipelines, CANDOCK and BANDOCK, can be used to create a protein library or add new proteins you think might be relevant to an existing protein library. Once these binding scores are generated,  they are arranged into a vector or list corresponding to each compound: the *proteomic signature* of that compound. These proteomic signatures are arranged into a drug-protein interaction matrix. Once this matrix is created, alongside a corresponding lists of compounds and any known compound-indication associations, CANDO can be used to make novel drug predictions."

    "To prepare for novel drug or indication prediction, CANDO first creates a compound-compound similarity matrix. Similarity scores are calculated based on the compound interaction signatures, with more similar interaction signatures having a higher similarity score. Finally, for each drug with a known effect, a sorted list of the most similar compounds to that drug is created. To predict a new drug for a given indication, the most similar compounds to all drugs already in that indication are compared. If a non-indicated drug is very similar to multiple inidcated drugs, that is, it appears in the top ranks of multiple similar lists, it will be predicted as a possible new drug in that indication. Likewise, to predict a new indication for a given compound, the indications of the drugs most similar to it are found. If multiple drugs similar to the compound have the same inidcation, the indication is returned as a potential use for that compound."

Every drug is withheld from its indication, and CANDO predicts novel drugs for that indication based on the remaining drugs. If the left out drug appears in these predictions, that is considered a success, as CANDO is able to predict the efficacy of that drug.\n",

    "  - A **Control nAIA** is also provided; this is the nAIA we would anticipate if CANDO worked as well as random chance\n",
    "- **Pairwise accuracy (PA)** - float, % of drugs that appear within a given cutoff in the similarity lists of drugs with the same indication\n",
    "  - PA assesses similarity list quality, whereas nAIA assesses prediction quality\n",
    "- **Indication coverage (IC)** - integer, the number of indications with a non-zero indication accuracy\n",

If using integer vectors, dist should be set to \"dice\", but binary vectors can be set to Tanimoto (\"tani\"). Next, it creates a dataframe of all potential binding sites for each protein in the specified protein library, protlib, with their corresponding binding site scores from the specified binding site prediction method, bs (\"coach\", \"cof\", \"ssite\", \"tms\"). The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the best score based on the following input parameters: 1) i_score - the scoring protocol of choice, which can be 'C', 'dC', 'P', 'CxP', 'dCxP', where C is the fingerprint similarity score (either Tanimoto or Sorenson-Dice coefficient), dC is the percentile of the C score for the compound compared to all ligands in the library, and P is binding site score associated with the ligand predicted by the COACH algorithm, 2) c_cutoff and p_cutoff - set cutoffs which ignore any C or P scores below each threshold, respectively, and 3) percentile_cutoff - similar to c_cutoff but with the dC score (overrides c_cutoff if not None). These scores serve as a proxy for binding strength/probability of the drug and protein target. We then output the matrix to a tsv file, out_file, which in this case is \"tutorial_matrix-all.tsv\" (out_path can be set to write the file to a specific directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a matrix using the 'CxP' protocol, which just chooses the top Dice score to any ligand predicted to bind to a given protein, without any cutoffs. This function is parallelized, so setting the variable ncpus will change the number of processors that are used for this function. NOTE: percentile cutoff protocols ('dC', 'dCxP') take much longer to compute than 'C' and 'P' protocols. "
